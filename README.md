## Motivations
When I was 8, my parents bought me this exact iconic Stratocaster guitar.

I fell in love with playing guitar and have been playing regularly ever since. I've since gotten a Telecaster and an Epiphone acoustic, 
but I still play that old Strat every now and again. No matter how old it gets, I still can't help admiring its classic and timeless design.  
  
That got me thinking: if the Stratocaster design is enough for me to instantly identify it, can I train a model to separate out Stratocaster
guitars from a pool other other electric guitars like those shown below?
